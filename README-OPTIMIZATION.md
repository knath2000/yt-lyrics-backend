# Docker Image Optimization Guide

## üö® Problem: 8.2GB Image Size Causing Railway Deployment Failures

The original Docker image was **8.2GB**, which exceeded Railway's deployment limits and caused build failures.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Optimized Multi-Stage Alpine Build

### Key Optimizations Applied

#### 1. **Multi-Stage Build**
- **Build stage**: Installs all dependencies and compiles the application
- **Runtime stage**: Contains only what's needed to run the application
- **Result**: Eliminates build tools, compilers, and temporary files from final image

#### 2. **Alpine Linux Base**
- Switched from `python:3.10-slim` (Debian-based) to `python:3.10-alpine`
- **Size reduction**: Alpine is ~5MB vs Debian's ~70MB base
- **Security**: Smaller attack surface with fewer packages

#### 3. **Dependency Layer Optimization**
Based on [Docker optimization best practices](https://dev.to/er_dward/dockerfile-optimization-using-multistage-builds-caching-and-lightweight-images-2ec6):
- Copy dependency files (`requirements.txt`, `package*.json`) before application code
- Enables Docker layer caching when only app code changes
- **Build time**: Reduces rebuilds from minutes to seconds

#### 4. **Aggressive Cleanup**
- Virtual build dependencies removed after compilation (`apk del .build-deps`)
- Package manager caches cleared (`npm cache clean --force`)
- APK cache removed (`rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*`)

#### 5. **Enhanced .dockerignore**
Expanded exclusions to prevent unnecessary files from entering build context:
- Development files, tests, documentation
- Audio/video test files
- Model caches and temporary files

## üìä Expected Results

| **Metric** | **Before** | **After** | **Improvement** |
|------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Image Size** | 8.2GB | 1.5-2GB | **75-80% reduction** |
| **Railway Deploy** | ‚ùå Fails | ‚úÖ Success | **Deploy possible** |
| **Build Time** | 10-15min | 3-5min | **50-70% faster** |
| **Pull Time** | 5-8min | 1-2min | **75% faster** |

## üöÄ How to Use

### Build the Optimized Image

```bash
# Make build script executable
chmod +x build-optimized.sh

# Build and check size
./build-optimized.sh
```

### Manual Build Command

```bash
docker build -t youtube-lyrics-backend:optimized .
```

### Deploy to Railway

1. **Commit these changes** to your repository
2. **Push to GitHub** (Railway will auto-deploy)
3. **Monitor Railway build logs** for success

### Local Testing

```bash
# Run the optimized container
docker run -p 3000:3000 youtube-lyrics-backend:optimized

# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## üîç Image Analysis Tools

### Using Dive (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dive (macOS)
brew install dive

# Analyze image layers
dive youtube-lyrics-backend:optimized
```

### Using Docker Commands

```bash
# Check image size
docker images youtube-lyrics-backend:optimized

# Inspect layers
docker history youtube-lyrics-backend:optimized
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Build Stage Components
- **Base**: `python:3.10-alpine`
- **Build deps**: gcc, g++, rust, cargo, nodejs, npm
- **Python packages**: PyTorch CPU, Demucs, application dependencies
- **Node.js packages**: Production dependencies only

### Runtime Stage Components
- **Base**: `python:3.10-alpine`
- **Runtime deps**: ffmpeg, libsndfile, openblas, nodejs, curl
- **Copied from builder**: Python packages, Node modules, application code

### Layer Caching Strategy
Following [AWS optimization patterns](https://www.javierinthecloud.com/optimizing-multi-architecture-container-image-builds-on-aws/):
1. **System dependencies** (rarely change)
2. **Package dependencies** (change moderately)
3. **Application code** (changes frequently)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails

1. **Check Alpine package availability**:
   ```bash
   # Some packages may have different names in Alpine
   apk search <package-name>
   ```

2. **Musl vs glibc compatibility**:
   - Some Python packages may need compilation for musl
   - Consider using `python:3.10-slim` if compatibility issues arise

3. **Memory limits during build**:
   - Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation
   - Or use cloud build services

### If Railway Still Fails

1. **Check Railway build logs** for specific errors
2. **Verify image size** is under Railway's limits
3. **Test locally first** before pushing

## ‚ö° Next Steps

1. **Monitor Railway deployment** success
2. **Test application functionality** in production
3. **Consider further optimizations** if needed:
   - Custom PyTorch build with minimal features
   - Distroless images for even smaller footprint
   - Container image scanning for security

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Demucs Installation Failure
**Problem**: `FileNotFoundError: requirements_minimal.txt` during demucs installation
- Demucs 3.0.x source distributions on PyPI are broken
- Missing `requirements_minimal.txt` file in sdist packages
- pip falls back to broken source builds when wheels unavailable

**Solution**: Pin to Demucs 4.x series (`demucs>=4.0,<5`)
- Ships pre-built wheels for Linux/Python 3.10
- Fixes packaging bug present in 3.x series
- Stable and widely used.

**Applied in**: `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile`
