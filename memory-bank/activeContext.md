# Active Context - Backend

_Last updated: 2025-04-07_

## Current Focus
- **DUAL DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE**: Backend is now deployed to both Railway and Fly.io platforms simultaneously
- **PERFORMANCE TESTING**: Frontend implements a racing system to compare speed and reliability between platforms
- **PRODUCTION READY**: Both deployments are stable and functional with complete transcription pipeline

## Current Deployment Status

### Railway Deployment
- **URL**: `https://yt-lyrics-backend-production.up.railway.app`
- **Status**: ✅ ACTIVE AND STABLE
- **Configuration**: Uses Railway's container platform with automatic scaling
- **Signal Handling**: Fixed with direct Node.js execution (`node dist/index.js`)

### Fly.io Deployment  
- **URL**: `https://yt-lyrics-backend.fly.dev`
- **Status**: ✅ ACTIVE AND STABLE
- **Configuration**: Uses Fly.io's global edge platform with auto-scaling machines
- **Region**: LAX (Los Angeles) primary region
- **Health Checks**: Configured with `/health` endpoint monitoring

## Recent Achievements

### ✅ MAJOR SUCCESS: Dual Platform Deployment (Latest)
- **Migration Complete**: Successfully moved from single Hugging Face Spaces deployment to dual Railway + Fly.io architecture
- **Performance Racing**: Frontend now submits jobs to both backends simultaneously to test speed and reliability
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic failover if one platform experiences issues
- **Winner Detection**: Frontend tracks which backend completes jobs first

### ✅ WhisperX Integration Resolved
- **Issue**: Previous WhisperX CLI argument parsing errors have been resolved
- **Solution**: Updated `whisperXProcessor.ts` to use modern positional arguments instead of deprecated `--audio`/`--transcript` flags
- **Status**: Word-level timestamp alignment now working correctly on both platforms

### ✅ Signal Handling Fix (Railway)
- **Issue**: Railway container termination due to improper signal handling with `npm start`
- **Solution**: Changed to direct Node.js execution (`node dist/index.js`) for proper SIGTERM handling
- **Result**: Graceful shutdowns and stable container lifecycle management

## Architecture Benefits

### Platform Redundancy
- **High Availability**: If one platform experiences issues, the other continues serving requests
- **Performance Comparison**: Real-time data on which platform performs better for different workloads
- **Geographic Distribution**: Fly.io provides global edge deployment, Railway provides reliable container hosting

### User Experience
- **Faster Results**: Users get results from whichever backend completes first
- **Reliability**: Backup platform ensures service availability
- **Transparency**: Users can see performance metrics for both platforms

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Collect data on completion times and success rates for both platforms
2. **Optimize Based on Data**: Use racing results to identify performance bottlenecks
3. **Cost Analysis**: Monitor resource usage and costs across both platforms

### Future Enhancements
1. **Smart Routing**: Implement intelligent routing based on historical performance data
2. **Regional Optimization**: Deploy to additional Fly.io regions based on user geography
3. **Load Balancing**: Implement weighted routing based on platform performance

## Known Issues
- **None Currently**: Both platforms are stable and performing well
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring in place for both deployments
