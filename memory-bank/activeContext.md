- **âœ… GIT INTEGRATION**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub repository

## Current Deployment Status

<!-- Railway + Modal Architecture - Both operational with cookie support -->
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Fully Operational â€“ Backend and Modal worker both deployed and functional
- **Database**: NeonDB migration completed and operational
- **GPU Processing**: Modal endpoint operational at `https://knath2000--youtube-transcription-transcribe-youtube.modal.run`
- **Cookie Support**: YouTube authentication implemented for both Railway and Modal fallback downloads

## Latest Session Achievements (2025-08-27)

### âœ… YOUTUBE BOT DETECTION RESOLUTION
- **PROBLEM SOLVED**: Fixed YouTube bot detection issues by implementing cookie authentication
- **COOKIE EXTRACTION**: Extracted 36 essential YouTube cookies (down from 1086) to avoid Railway length limits
- **DUAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Added cookie support to both Railway primary downloads and Modal fallback downloads
- **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE**: Uses `YOUTUBE_COOKIES_CONTENT` environment variable for secure cookie storage
- **BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Maintains functionality when cookies are not available

### âœ… MODAL WORKER ENHANCEMENT
- **CODE UPDATES**: Enhanced `modal/transcribe.py` with cookie file creation and cleanup logic
- **TEMPORARY FILES**: Proper handling of temporary cookie files with automatic cleanup
- **ERROR HANDLING**: Comprehensive error handling for cookie setup and yt-dlp failures
- **LOGGING**: Added detailed logging for cookie usage and fallback download status

### âœ… DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS
- **MODAL DEPLOYMENT**: Successfully deployed updated worker in 2.598 seconds
- **ENDPOINT VERIFICATION**: Modal function available and responding correctly
- **GIT INTEGRATION**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub repository
- **VERSION CONTROL**: Commit `9aad747` with descriptive message about cookie support

## Current Architecture Status

### Railway Backend (Primary)
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Operational with cookie support
- **Endpoint**: `https://web-production-5905c.up.railway.app`
- **Database**: NeonDB connection stable and functional
- **Cookie Support**: YouTube authentication for primary downloads

### Modal GPU Worker (Fallback)
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Operational with enhanced cookie support
- **Endpoint**: `https://knath2000--youtube-transcription-transcribe-youtube.modal.run`
- **GPU Processing**: A10G instances ready for intensive transcription tasks
- **Cookie Support**: YouTube authentication for fallback downloads when Railway fails

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cookie Handling System
```python
# Modal fallback download with cookie support
cookie_file_path = None
if os.environ.get("YOUTUBE_COOKIES_CONTENT"):
    try:
        # Create temporary cookie file from environment variable
        import base64
        cookies_content = os.environ.get("YOUTUBE_COOKIES_CONTENT")
        if cookies_content:
            # Decode if base64 encoded
            try:
                decoded_cookies = base64.b64decode(cookies_content).decode('utf-8')
            except:
                decoded_cookies = cookies_content
            
            cookie_file_path = temp_path / "youtube_cookies.txt"
            with open(cookie_file_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write(decoded_cookies)
            
            cmd.extend(["--cookies", str(cookie_file_path)])
            print("[Modal] Using cookies for fallback download")
    except Exception as cookie_error:
        print(f"[Modal] Cookie setup warning: {cookie_error}")
```

### Deployment Results
