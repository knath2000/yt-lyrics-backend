# Active Context - Backend

_Last updated: 2025-07-03_

## Current Focus
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Resolving `yt-dlp` `Impersonate target "chrome" is not available` error in the Hugging Face deployment. This is the primary blocker.
- The transcription pipeline fails at the first step, preventing any further processing.

## Recent Changes & Investigations
- **Failed `yt-dlp` Dependency Fixes**:
  - Attempted to install `yt-dlp[default,curl-cffi]` via `nixpacks.toml`.
  - Attempted to add `curl` and `libcurl` to `nixPkgs` in `nixpacks.toml`.
  - Both attempts resulted in the same `Impersonate target "chrome" is not available` error, indicating a deeper issue with the Nixpacks build environment's ability to compile `curl_cffi`.

## Next Steps
1. **Pause and Re-evaluate**: The immediate priority is to stop further attempts and document the current state of the issue for future investigation.
2. **Future Investigation**:
   - Research how to correctly provide C-bindings for Python packages in a Nix/Nixpacks environment.
   - Explore alternative impersonation methods or `yt-dlp` forks that may not have the same dependencies.
   - Consider removing the `--impersonate` flag temporarily to see if the `403 Forbidden` error can be resolved with other methods (e.g., more advanced cookie handling, proxy rotation).

## Known Issues
- **`yt-dlp` impersonation fails in production**: The `Impersonate target "chrome" is not available` error persists despite attempts to install `curl_cffi` and its dependencies.
