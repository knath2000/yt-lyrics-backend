### ✅ FEATURE: Cloudinary Audio Caching System (2025-07-06)
- **Achievement**: Implemented cloud-based caching for extracted YouTube audio
- **Caching Features**:
  - Consistent naming pattern: `audio/{videoId}/bestaudio_mp3`
  - Tagging with `yt_audio_cache` and `video:<id>` for management
  - Cache-first approach to eliminate redundant downloads
  - Fetch and local storage of cached audio when available
- **Impact**: Reduces processing time and bandwidth for repeat requests
- **Status**: Implementation complete but limited by YouTube download issues

### ✅ ENHANCEMENT: Robust YouTube URL Parsing (2025-07-06)
- **Achievement**: Created comprehensive videoId extraction function
- **Supported Formats**:
  - Standard watch URLs: `youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
  - Short URLs: `youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
  - Shorts: `youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID`
  - URLs with additional query parameters
- **Impact**: Ensures consistent caching regardless of URL format
- **Status**: Working correctly for all URL formats

### ✅ ENHANCEMENT: Multi-Strategy Fallback Chain (2025-07-06)
- **Achievement**: Expanded download strategies with more fallback options
- **New Options**:
  - Added generic format options without specific format filters
  - Included both authenticated and unauthenticated attempts
  - Improved error handling and reporting
- **Impact**: Increased resilience against YouTube format changes
- **Status**: Implemented but not resolving current signature extraction issues

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: YouTube Signature Extraction Failures (2025-07-06)
- **Issue**: YouTube's June 2025 updates causing "Signature extraction failed" errors
- **Symptoms**:
  - "Only images are available for download" messages
  - Failed downloads with all format strategies
  - yt-dlp unable to extract audio formats
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Updated Docker container to use latest yt-dlp binary
  - Added symlink to ensure latest binary is used
  - Implemented additional fallback strategies
- **Current Status**: Issue persists; rollback to stable commit 669856c required

### ✅ CRITICAL: Rollback to Stable Commit (2025-07-04)
- **Issue**: Quality tier system causing download failures with YouTube's anti-bot measures
- **Solution**: Rolled back to stable commit 669856c before quality tier implementation
- **Process**: Created backup branch, checked out stable commit, created new branch, pushed to main
- **Result**: Restored reliable transcription pipeline without quality tiers

### ✅ MAJOR: Database & Cloud Storage Integration (2025-07-05)
- **Achievement**: Successfully integrated PostgreSQL database and Cloudinary cloud storage
- **Database Features**:
  - PostgreSQL connection with pg pool for efficient connection management
  - Jobs table with comprehensive schema for tracking transcription jobs
  - Automatic table creation and setup via `setupDatabase()` function
  - Health checks with database connectivity verification
- **Cloud Storage Features**:
  - Cloudinary integration for storing transcription results permanently
  - JSON results uploaded to `transcriptions/{jobId}/results` folder
  - SRT files uploaded to `transcriptions/{jobId}/subtitles` folder
  - Secure URL generation for frontend access
- **Impact**: Jobs now persist across server restarts, results stored permanently in cloud
- **Result**: Complete production-ready system with persistent storage
