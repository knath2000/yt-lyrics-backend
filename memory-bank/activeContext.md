## Current Deployment Status

<!-- Fly.io deployment removed; Railway/Modal only -->
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Active â€“ Railway deployment stable with PostgreSQL database integration
- **Database**: Uses PostgreSQL database via `DATABASE_URL` Railway environment variable
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation successful with proper dev dependencies
- **Health**: `/health` endpoint checks every 30s with database connectivity validation
- **GPU Processing**: Primary path via Modal with Groq Whisper Large-v3 Turbo
- **Modal Endpoint**: `https://knath2000--youtube-transcription-transcribe-youtube.modal.run`

## Latest Session Achievements (2025-08-25)

### âœ… MODAL WORKER DEPLOYMENT
- **SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT**: Deployed Modal worker (`modal/transcribe.py`) with all dependencies
- **ENDPOINT LIVE**: Modal function available at `https://knath2000--youtube-transcription-transcribe-youtube.modal.run`
- **SECURES CONFIGURED**: All required secrets verified (`cloudinary-config`, `openai-api-key`, `groq-api-key`, `youtube-cookies`)
- **TESTED CONNECTIVITY**: Endpoint responds correctly with proper error handling for YouTube authentication
- **DEPENDENCY FIX**: Installed missing `requests` package for successful deployment

### âœ… RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT STABILIZATION
- **MERGE CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: Fixed CORS configuration conflict in src/index.ts with regex-based origin matching
- **TYPESCRIPT DEPENDENCY**: Added TypeScript as dev dependency to ensure successful builds
- **DATABASE INTEGRATION**: Configured PostgreSQL database on Railway, resolving ECONNREFUSED errors
- **BUILD VERIFICATION**: Confirmed TypeScript compilation and Docker build process working correctly

### âœ… ENHANCED CORS CONFIGURATION
- **REGEX-BASED ORIGIN MATCHING**: Support for localhost, Vercel, Render, and custom origins
- **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SUPPORT**: `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` for additional allowed origins
- **OPTIONS HANDLING**: Proper CORS preflight request support
- **SECURITY**: Maintained credentials support with proper origin validation

### âœ… GROQ WHISPER LARGE-V3 TURBO INTEGRATION
- **PERFORMANCE BREAKTHROUGH**: 15-20x speed improvement (1-2s vs 60-90s processing time)
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Integrated Groq API with fallback to Faster-Whisper for reliability
- **WORD TIMESTAMPS**: Groq provides precise word-level timestamps, eliminating need for WhisperX alignment
- **SECURITY**: Properly configured `GROQ_API_KEY` Modal secret, removed hardcoded keys
- **ERROR HANDLING**: Fixed Groq API response parsing for both dict and object formats

### âœ… COMPREHENSIVE STATUS TRACKING SYSTEM
- **ENHANCED MODAL PROGRESS**: Detailed progress logging with timestamps and processing stages
- **ADVANCED QUEUE WORKER**: ProcessingStep interface with status, percentage, message, timestamp, duration
- **DATABASE SCHEMA ENHANCEMENT**: Added columns for pct, status_message, current_stage, processing_method, processing_time_seconds, video_id, progress_log (JSONB)
- **REAL-TIME API**: New /api/jobs/:id/steps endpoint for detailed step tracking with time estimates
- **PROGRESS MAPPING**: Modal progress (30%-95%) mapped to overall job progress with comprehensive metadata

### âœ… CRITICAL DATABASE FIXES
- **COLUMN MISMATCH RESOLUTION**: Fixed `result_url` â†’ `results_url` and `error` â†’ `error_message` column name issues
- **FRONTEND COMPLETION**: Resolved frontend stuck at 95% by ensuring proper database updates
- **API CONSISTENCY**: Updated jobs API routes to use correct column names matching schema
- **QUEUE WORKER FIXES**: All database operations now use proper column names preventing PostgreSQL errors

### âœ… CLOUDINARY CACHE OPTIMIZATION
- **INTELLIGENT CACHE CHECKING**: Worker checks Cloudinary cache before attempting YouTube downloads
- **REDUNDANCY ELIMINATION**: Skips yt-dlp download if audio already cached in Cloudinary
- **PERFORMANCE BOOST**: Immediate processing for previously downloaded content
- **PROGRESS TRANSPARENCY**: Clear messaging about cache hits vs new downloads

## Technical Stack Details (Current State)

### Ultra-Fast Audio Processing Pipeline
- **Stage 1: Download Orchestration (Railway)** 
  - **Cache Check**: Intelligent Cloudinary cache verification before download attempts
  - **YouTube Download**: Authenticated yt-dlp download with cookie support
  - **Audio Upload**: Successful downloads uploaded to Cloudinary for Modal access
  - **Fallback Coordination**: Failed downloads trigger Modal fallback processing

- **Stage 2: GPU Processing (Modal)**
  - **PRIMARY: Groq Whisper Large-v3 Turbo**: Ultra-fast transcription (1-2 seconds)
  - **FALLBACK: Faster-Whisper**: GPU-optimized transcription with local models
  - **Demucs**: GPU-accelerated vocal separation for better transcription quality
  - **Conditional Alignment**: WhisperX only for Faster-Whisper (Groq provides word timestamps)
  - **Result Upload**: Direct upload to Cloudinary from Modal with comprehensive metadata

- **Stage 3: Result Coordination (Railway)**
  - **Database Update**: Comprehensive job status and metadata updates with correct column names
  - **Frontend Access**: Real-time progress API with detailed step tracking
  - **Progress Tracking**: End-to-end visibility with processing method identification

### Performance Metrics (Current)
- **Groq Processing**: 1-2 seconds for typical 3-4 minute songs (15-20x improvement)
- **Faster-Whisper Fallback**: ~30-45 seconds for same content
- **Cache Hits**: Immediate processing for previously downloaded content
- **Overall Pipeline**: 60-90 seconds total (including download and upload) vs previous 60-90s for transcription alone

### Database Integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent job storage with comprehensive status tracking
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Enhanced Schema**: Includes processing_method, processing_time_seconds, video_id, progress_log
- **Result Storage**: Cloudinary URLs stored in `results_url` field (fixed column name)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging in `error_message` field (fixed column name)
