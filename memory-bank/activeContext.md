# Active Context - Backend

_Last updated: 2025-07-01_

## Current Focus
- Enhanced audio processing pipeline with improved error handling
- Robust Demucs integration with audio backend compatibility checks
- Comprehensive transcription workflow with multiple fallback options

## Recent Changes
- **Major Demucs Enhancement**: Added audio backend detection (soundfile, librosa)
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages for missing dependencies
- **Audio Format Compatibility**: Added MP3 output support and CPU-only processing
- **Environment Variables**: Enhanced audio backend configuration
- **Whisper Integration**: Robust API key handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Deployment Setup**: Backend repo initialized, pushed to GitHub, and linked to Railway for CI/CD
- **Nixpacks Build Configuration**:
  - Removed problematic `pip install --upgrade pip`
  - Pinned Python 3.11 & Node 20 toolchains
  - Added `setuptools`, `wheel`, and `libsndfile` system packages
  - Separated Torch (CPU-only) and Demucs installs to mitigate wheel failures
- **Build Troubleshooting**: Investigated Railway build logs, planned local Nixpacks CLI testing

## Next Steps
1. Reproduce Railway build locally with Nixpacks CLI; resolve PyTorch 3.11 wheel install issue
2. Once build succeeds, confirm automatic deploy pipeline on Railway
3. Add job persistence (SQLite/Redis) for production reliability
4. Implement S3 upload for processed audio files
5. Add comprehensive logging, monitoring, and timeout handling for large downloads

## Known Issues
- Large YouTube downloads take long; no timeouts.
- Demucs flag disabled; returning false in `isDemucsAvailable()`.
