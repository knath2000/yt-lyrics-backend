# Consolidated Learnings - YouTube Lyrics Transcription System

## System Architecture Patterns

### Queue-Based Processing Architecture
**Pattern: Separate API and Worker Processes**
- API server handles requests and returns immediately with job IDs
- Separate queue worker polls database for jobs and processes them
- In-memory progress tracking (jobProgress Map) bridges real-time updates
- *Rationale:* Prevents API blocking during long-running transcription jobs, enables better resource management and scalability

### Multi-Tier Fallback Strategy
**Pattern: Resilient External Service Integration**
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
### Explicit Player-Client Switching (yt-dlp)
**Pattern: Auth/Unauth Client Sequencing**
- Attempt authenticated clients (`tv`, `ios`, `web`) first when cookies exist, then unauthenticated equivalents.
- Use temporary cookie files hydrated from `YOUTUBE_COOKIES_CONTENT` or startup cookie jar.
- Log full command and stderr for failed attempts to speed diagnosis.
- Rationale: YouTube client-specific behavior changes frequently; explicit client selection increases success rate.

>>>>>>> 339124e (fix(runtime): remove 'exec' from start; Dockerfile CMD node dist/index.js; robust CORS (regex allowlist + OPTIONS))
- YtDlpDownloader implements 4-tier fallback: authenticated/unauthenticated × m4a/best formats
- Each tier has specific error handling and timeout configurations
- Graceful degradation when authentication or preferred formats fail
- *Rationale:* YouTube actively blocks scrapers; multiple strategies maximize success rate

### Memory-Aware Processing
**Pattern: Adaptive Resource Management**
- Demucs processor checks memory-safe mode and audio duration
- Skips resource-intensive operations for long audio in constrained environments
- Environment-based configuration (production vs development defaults)
- *Rationale:* Balances quality vs reliability based on available server resources

## Frontend-Backend Integration Patterns
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
### API-Driven GPU Offload
**Pattern: Public Function Endpoint with Progress Mapping**
- Submit jobs to a serverless GPU endpoint via HTTPS; stream or poll progress into DB and expose via `/progress` and `/steps`.
- Keep local CPU/GPU fallback path for resilience.
- Rationale: Decouples orchestration from heavy compute; simplifies credentials by using a public function URL when appropriate.

>>>>>>> 339124e (fix(runtime): remove 'exec' from start; Dockerfile CMD node dist/index.js; robust CORS (regex allowlist + OPTIONS))

### Real-Time Progress Communication
**Pattern: Polling with In-Memory State Bridge**
- Backend maintains jobProgress Map for active jobs
- Frontend polls with adaptive frequency (1s during processing, less frequent otherwise)
- Database serves as fallback for completed jobs
- *Rationale:* Provides responsive UI updates without overwhelming the database

### Multi-Format Result Display
**Pattern: Client-Side Result Processing**
- Results stored once in Cloudinary as comprehensive JSON
- Frontend fetches and transforms for different view modes (SRT, plain text, word-by-word)
- Download functionality generates files client-side
- *Rationale:* Reduces server load and provides flexible user experience

## Processing Pipeline Patterns

### Modular Processing Chain
**Pattern: Composable Audio Processing Pipeline**
- Each step (download, separation, transcription, alignment) is a separate utility class
- Clear interfaces between components (DownloadResult, TranscriptionResult, etc.)
- Optional steps can be skipped based on availability or constraints
- *Rationale:* Enables testing individual components and graceful degradation

### Graceful Cleanup and Resource Management
**Pattern: Comprehensive Resource Lifecycle Management**
- TranscriptionWorker tracks active jobs and implements cleanup methods
- Temporary files are cleaned up even on errors
- Graceful shutdown handling with timeout mechanisms
- *Rationale:* Prevents resource leaks in long-running server processes

## Database and State Management

### Hybrid State Storage
**Pattern: Database + In-Memory for Different Use Cases**
- Database for persistent job metadata and completed results
- In-memory Map for real-time progress during active processing
- Clear separation of concerns between persistence and real-time updates
- *Rationale:* Optimizes for both data durability and real-time responsiveness

### Progressive Job Status Updates
**Pattern: Multi-Stage Status Tracking**
- Job status: queued → processing → completed/error
- Progress percentage with descriptive status messages
- Database updates at key milestones, in-memory for granular progress
- *Rationale:* Provides comprehensive job lifecycle visibility

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Comprehensive Error Capture
**Pattern: Multi-Level Error Handling**
- Individual utility classes handle their specific error cases
- Worker level aggregates and contextualizes errors
- API level provides user-friendly error responses
- Database stores error details for debugging
- *Rationale:* Enables both user experience and operational debugging

### Fallback and Retry Strategies
**Pattern: Graceful Degradation with Fallbacks**
- Multiple download strategies for YouTube blocking
- Optional processing steps (Demucs) that can be skipped
- Timeout and retry mechanisms at each level
- *Rationale:* Maximizes success rate despite external service unreliability

## Deployment and Configuration

### Environment-Aware Configuration
**Pattern: Adaptive Defaults Based on Environment**
- Production optimizes for performance (memory-safe mode OFF)
- Development prioritizes safety (memory-safe mode ON)
- Environment variables override defaults when needed
- *Rationale:* Balances safety in development with performance in production

### External Service Integration
**Pattern: Configurable Service Dependencies**
- OpenAI model selection via environment variables
- Cloudinary for scalable file storage
- PostgreSQL for reliable job persistence
- *Rationale:* Enables flexible deployment and service provider choices

  - Tag cached files with `yt_audio_cache` and `video:<id>` for easy management
  - Check cache before downloading to eliminate redundant processing
  - **Rationale:** Eliminates redundant processing for repeated URLs, reduces bandwidth usage, and improves response time for previously processed videos.

### YouTube Download Resilience
- **Pattern: Multi-Strategy Fallback Chain**
  - Implement a cascade of download strategies with different format specifications
  - Start with most compatible formats (m4a) and fall back to more generic options
  - Include both authenticated and unauthenticated attempts
  - **Rationale:** YouTube's anti-bot measures and format availability change frequently; a resilient fallback chain improves success rates.

### YouTube URL Parsing
- **Pattern: Robust Video ID Extraction**
  - Extract the canonical 11-character YouTube video ID from various URL formats:
    - Standard watch URLs: `youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
    - Short URLs: `youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
    - Shorts: `youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID`
    - URLs with additional query parameters
  - **Rationale:** Consistent ID extraction ensures proper caching and deduplication regardless of URL format.

### YouTube Download Challenges
- **Issue: YouTube Signature Extraction Failures**
  - Recent YouTube updates (June 2025) have introduced more aggressive anti-bot measures
  - Symptoms include "Signature extraction failed" and "Only images are available" errors
  - **Solution:** Keep yt-dlp binary up-to-date with symlinks in Docker container
  - **Alternative:** Rollback to stable commits when new anti-bot measures break functionality

### ESM Import Compatibility
- **Pattern: Consistent Module Path Resolution**
  - In Node.js ESM environments, always include file extensions in import paths (e.g., `../cloudinary.js`)
  - Different behavior between TypeScript compilation and runtime requires careful path management
  - **Rationale:** Prevents "Cannot find module" errors in production environments

## Critical Bug Recovery Patterns
