# Progress Log - Backend

## What Works
- **Core API**: Endpoints `/api/jobs`, `/api/jobs/:id`, `/api/jobs/:id/result` fully operational
- **Audio Processing**: Complete pipeline from YouTube download to transcription
- **Whisper Integration**: Robust transcription with OpenAI API and local Whisper fallback
- **Demucs Integration**: Full vocal separation with audio backend compatibility
- **Alignment System**: Word-level timestamp alignment and SRT generation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback

## What's Left
- **Persistence**: Job state storage (SQLite/Redis implementation)
- **Cloud Storage**: S3 upload for processed files and results
- **Performance**: Optimize for large file processing and concurrent jobs
- **Authentication**: User management and API key security (future)

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ Enhanced Demucs with audio backend detection
- ✅ Improved error handling across all processing stages
- ✅ Added MP3 compatibility and CPU-only processing
- ✅ Robust environment configuration management
- ✅ Integrated GitHub repository & enabled Railway auto-deploy
- ✅ Refactored `nixpacks.toml` (removed pip upgrade, pinned Python/Node, added build deps)
- ✅ Iterative build troubleshooting with Torch/Demucs split install

## Known Issues
- Large YouTube downloads need timeout handling
- Memory usage optimization for concurrent processing
- Need production-grade job queue system
- Railway build still failing on PyTorch 3.11 CPU wheel; requires investigation
