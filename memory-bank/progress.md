# Progress - Backend

_Last updated: 2025-08-26_

## ‚úÖ NEONDB MIGRATION INITIATED
- **DATABASE MIGRATION**: Started migration from Railway PostgreSQL to NeonDB for improved performance and scalability
- **CODE UPDATES**: Modified [`src/db.ts`](src/db.ts) to remove environment-based SSL configuration
- **SSL CONFIGURATION**: Now relying on NeonDB connection string's `sslmode=require` parameter
