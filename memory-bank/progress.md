# Progress Log - Backend

## What Works
- **Core API**: Endpoints `/api/jobs`, `/api/jobs/:id`, `/api/jobs/:id/result` fully operational
- **Audio Processing**: Complete pipeline from YouTube download to transcription
- **Whisper Integration**: Robust transcription with OpenAI API and local Whisper fallback
- **Demucs Integration**: Full vocal separation with audio backend compatibility
- **Alignment System**: Word-level timestamp alignment and SRT generation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
- **Railway Deployment**: Fixed PyTorch CPU installation with optimized build configuration

## What's Left
- **Persistence**: Job state storage (SQLite/Redis implementation)
- **Cloud Storage**: S3 upload for processed files and results
- **Performance**: Optimize for large file processing and concurrent jobs
- **Authentication**: User management and API key security (future)

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ Enhanced Demucs with audio backend detection
- ✅ Improved error handling across all processing stages
- ✅ Added MP3 compatibility and CPU-only processing
- ✅ Robust environment configuration management
- ✅ Integrated GitHub repository & enabled Railway auto-deploy
- ✅ Refactored `nixpacks.toml` (removed pip upgrade, pinned Python/Node, added build deps)
- ✅ Iterative build troubleshooting with Torch/Demucs split install
- ✅ **RESOLVED: Railway PyTorch Installation** - Fixed with npm-based build and optimized PyTorch CPU wheel strategy

## Railway Deployment Solution
**Problem**: PyTorch CPU wheel installation failing in nixpacks build environment
**Root Cause**: Complex workspace setup and pip/PyTorch wheel compatibility issues
**Solution Implemented**:
- Switched from pnpm workspace setup to npm for Railway compatibility
- Used `--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` instead of `--extra-index-url` for PyTorch installation
- Simplified nixpacks.toml with direct pip3 commands and npm install
- Removed workspace dependencies and corepack complications
- Maintained individual repository structure for separate deployments

## Known Issues
- Large YouTube downloads need timeout handling
- Memory usage optimization for concurrent processing
- Need production-grade job queue system
