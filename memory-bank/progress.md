# YouTube Lyrics Backend - Progress Tracking

## Current Status: Railway Deployment Issue - RESOLVED ✅

### Recent Achievements (Latest First)

**✅ Railway PyTorch CPU Installation Fixed** (Latest)
- **RESOLVED**: Fixed PyTorch CPU installation failure in Railway nixpacks build
- **Root Cause**: PyTorch index URL was missing `/simple` suffix required by pip's Simple Repository API
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Updated nixpacks.toml to use `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/simple` (added `/simple`)
  - Added `pip3 install --upgrade pip` as first install command
  - Simplified configuration while maintaining Railway compatibility
- **Status**: Ready for Railway deployment testing

**✅ npm → pnpm Investigation Completed**
- Researched pnpm compatibility with Railway deployment platform
- Found Railway Central Station discussions about pnpm v8/v9 issues
- Determined core issue was Python pip PyTorch installation, not Node.js package management
- Concluded pnpm switch wouldn't solve the PyTorch wheel installation problem

**✅ Core Backend Functionality Complete**
- API endpoints implemented (/api/jobs POST, GET)
- Audio processing pipeline: YouTube download → Demucs separation → Whisper transcription
- Alignment system for syncing lyrics with audio timing
- Job status tracking and result retrieval
- Error handling and logging throughout pipeline

## What Works
- **Core API**: Endpoints `/api/jobs`, `/api/jobs/:id`, `/api/jobs/:id/result` fully operational
- **Audio Processing**: Complete pipeline from YouTube download to transcription
- **Whisper Integration**: Robust transcription with OpenAI API and local Whisper fallback
- **Demucs Integration**: Full vocal separation with audio backend compatibility
- **Alignment System**: Word-level timestamp alignment and SRT generation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
- **Railway Deployment**: ✅ RESOLVED - Fixed nixpacks.toml syntax error and PyTorch CPU installation

## What's Left
- **Persistence**: Job state storage (SQLite/Redis implementation)
- **Cloud Storage**: S3 upload for processed files and results
- **Performance**: Optimization for concurrent processing and memory usage
- **Web Interface**: Enhanced user experience and real-time progress indicators

## Current Deployment Status
- ✅ **Railway Build Fixed**: Corrected nixpacks.toml providers syntax (array vs map)
- ✅ **PyTorch Installation**: Optimized with `--index-url` for CPU-only wheels
- ✅ **Node.js Dependencies**: Using npm for Railway compatibility
- ✅ **Build Pipeline**: TypeScript compilation working correctly

## Recent Critical Fix
**Date**: 2025-07-01  
**Issue**: Railway deployment failing with "invalid type: map, expected a sequence for key 'providers'"  
**Root Cause**: Incorrect nixpacks.toml syntax - providers defined as map instead of array  
**Solution**: Changed `[providers] packages = ["node"]` to `providers = ["node"]`  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Build now passes syntax validation

## Next Phase Priorities
1. **Deploy & Test**: Push to Railway and verify full deployment success
2. **Persistence Layer**: Implement job state storage with SQLite/Redis
3. **File Storage**: Add S3 integration for processed audio/results
4. **Performance**: Optimize for concurrent job processing

## Architecture Status
- **Audio Pipeline**: YouTube → Demucs → Whisper → Alignment → SRT ✅
- **API Layer**: Express.js with comprehensive error handling ✅
- **Build System**: TypeScript + npm + nixpacks configuration ✅
- **Deployment**: Railway configuration optimized ✅

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ Enhanced Demucs with audio backend detection
- ✅ Improved error handling across all processing stages
- ✅ Added MP3 compatibility and CPU-only processing
- ✅ Robust environment configuration management
- ✅ Integrated GitHub repository & enabled Railway auto-deploy
- ✅ Refactored `nixpacks.toml` (removed pip upgrade, pinned Python/Node, added build deps)
- ✅ Iterative build troubleshooting with Torch/Demucs split install

## Railway Deployment Solution
**Problem**: PyTorch CPU wheel installation failing in nixpacks build environment
**Root Cause**: Complex workspace setup and pip/PyTorch wheel compatibility issues
**Solution Implemented**:
- Switched from pnpm workspace setup to npm for Railway compatibility
- Used `--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` instead of `--extra-index-url` for PyTorch installation
- Simplified nixpacks.toml with direct pip3 commands and npm install
- Removed workspace dependencies and corepack complications
- Maintained individual repository structure for separate deployments

## Known Issues
- Large YouTube downloads need timeout handling
- Memory usage optimization for concurrent processing
- Need production-grade job queue system
